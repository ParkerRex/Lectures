# Lecture 0 - Scratch

Get comfortable being uncomfortable

Youâ€™ll learn how to program.

Not specifically a language.

After CS50. You can teach yourself new languages.

Computer science is about solving problems.

Today:

- [ ] Learn how to represent images
- [ ] Learn how to represent numbers
- [ ] Learn how to represent videos
- [ ] Learn how to represent audio

- Javascript
- SQL
- Python

Do everything serially:

Pick up the phone book
Open to middle of the phone bookLook at page 
if person is on the page 
    Call person 
Else if person is earlier in book
    Open to middle of left half of book
    Go back to line 3
Else if person is later in book 
    Open to middle of right half of book
    Go back to line 3
Else    
    Quit



## Part 2 - Chatbots

If student says hello
    Say hello back
Else if student says goodbye
    Say goodbye back
Else if stuydent asks how you are 
    Say you're well
Else if student asks why 111 in binary is 7 in decimal


It would be impossible to write code that would be able to guess what the person is going to ask.

#### Large Language Models
Takes as input LOTS and LOTS of language.
eg. Wikipedias, Encyclopedias, Web Pages.

It infers from what the question says, what the probabilistic chances are that you'd answer.

Eg. If someone on the street asks how you're doing.
90% of the time someone would reply and say I'm good!

> A hallucination is a bit of randomness sprinkled in. 

Eg. If you said I'm not doing good.

Tools:
1. ChatGPT
2. Bing

Do not use AI-Based Software besides CS50's own. 

#include <studio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}


printf is a function. 

The function is to display things on the screen. 

Everything else is a distraction *for now*.

When it comes time to write code, we use VS code using preinstalled dependencies.
